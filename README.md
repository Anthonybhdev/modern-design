## Overview

![screenshot]("Modern-Interior-webpage.png")

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- The demo of this site can be found on Github under Modern Design.

- My personal experience with this site is that understanding media queries is a must if you are going to make responsive websites using only HTML & CSS. And the ability to control the screen layout with the use of media query and good old CSS. The site isn't perfect but by building it my knowledge and experience is growing. 

- I learned the importance of responsive design.

- And my biggest take away when building anything is it's okay not to know the answer. Just use Google & youtube to figure it out.

### Built With



- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)


## Features



This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The Modern Interior challenge (https://devchallenges.io/challenges/Jymh2b2FyebRTUljkNcb) was to build an application to complete the given user stories. So, basically the site is a static webpage that is responsive and also have a collapsable navbar after hitting the break out point.
